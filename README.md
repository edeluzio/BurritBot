This is a Discord bot that I have developed and maintained since 2021, and run for personal use on a server with my friends.

It features a wide variety of features including:
- Relaying a user's competitive rank and content store in Valorant (a video game) without the need to launch the game
- The ability to directly copy all user settings and preferences from one Valorant account to another with one simple command
- Randomly selecting a movie given a set of suggestions
- Giving movies an average rating based on the discord members votes which is then compared to the Rotten Tomato ratings of the same movie
- The ability to play songs from various websites like YouTube and Soundcloud within a voice channel in the server
- Tracking the amount of time members of the server have spent in a voice channel

Features are contiunously added based on my friends and I's current desires.
